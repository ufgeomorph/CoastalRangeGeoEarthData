                        FROM A 1986 MON.)

GENERAL NOTES :-BE CAREFUL OF APPARENT DUNE CHANGES WHICH MAY NOT BE REAL
                BUT MAY BE DUE TO USE OF '79 DOT LANDWARD DATA IN '84
                SURVEY VS MEASURED DATA IN '86 SURVEY.  SOME DOT PTS MAY
                NOT BE GOOD DUE TO DIFFICULT TERRAIN OR MIXUP.

               -Many of the 1999 offshore profiles appear to be
                systematically lower than in previous offshore surveys.
